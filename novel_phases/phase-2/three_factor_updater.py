    Applies a three-factor Hebbian-like update to the weights of a given layer.

    Args:
        layer_to_update (nn.Module): The layer whose weights are to be updated.
                                     Typically nn.Linear or nn.Conv2d.
                                     Must have a `weight` attribute.
        eligibility_trace (torch.Tensor): The eligibility trace accumulated for the weights.
                                          Shape should match layer_to_update.weight.data.
        return_to_go (torch.Tensor): The third factor, typically a scalar reward signal
                                     or return-to-go value. If it's a tensor, it should
                                     be broadcastable with the eligibility_trace.
        local_learning_rate (float): The learning rate for this local update rule.
        clip_value (Optional[float]): If provided, the absolute value of the computed
                                      weight change (delta_W) will be clipped to this value.
        normalize (bool): If True, the computed weight change (delta_W) will be normalized
                          (e.g., by its L2 norm) before being applied. This can help
                          stabilize updates. Clipping and normalization are mutually exclusive
                          in this implementation (normalization takes precedence).
