            # Our current CustomLIFCell's forward expects input `x` to be pre-synaptic spikes for its *own* trace.
            # This means CustomLIFCell needs to see the spikes that, when multiplied by weights, become its input current.
            # So, the trace in lif1 (hidden_size, hidden_size) is for an implicit recurrent connection if input is output of fc1.
            # OR, if lif1's trace is (input_size_to_fc1, hidden_size_of_lif1), then CustomLIFCell's input_size
            # must match fc1's input_size, and its `forward` needs to be called with `x_t`.
            #
            # Let's adjust CustomLIFCell's design philosophy slightly for this example:
            # The CustomLIFCell is associated with the weights of fc1.
            # Pre-synaptic activity = x_t (input to fc1)
            # Post-synaptic activity = s_lif1 (output of lif1)
            # The eligibility trace should be (fc1.in_features, fc1.out_features)
            # This means CustomLIFCell must be aware of x_t.
            #
            # For now, let's assume lif1.eligibility_trace is (fc1.out_features, fc1.out_features)
            # and it's updated based on lif1_current and s_lif1.
            # To make it (fc1.in_features, fc1.out_features) as desired for fc1's weights,
            # CustomLIFCell's `forward` needs access to `x_t` that went into `fc1`.
            # This requires a slight refactor of CustomLIFCell or how it's called.
            #
            # For this example, let's assume CustomLIFCell is modified or used such that:
            # its `update_trace(pre_syn_activity, post_syn_activity)` is called manually, OR
            # its `forward` is modified to accept `pre_syn_for_trace` explicitly.
            #
            # Simpler approach for now: The `CustomLIFCell` as written takes `x` (its direct input current or spikes)
            # and `s_out` (its output spikes). So its trace is `(input_to_cell, output_of_cell)`.
            # If `lif1` is our custom cell, its trace is `(hidden_size, hidden_size)`.
            # This means the trace is for weights *within* `lif1` (e.g. recurrent) or for `fc1` IF `fc1`'s output is `hidden_size`.
            #
            # Let's make `lif1` have trace `(input_size, hidden_size)` corresponding to `fc1`.
            # This implies `CustomLIFCell` needs to be initialized with `(input_size, hidden_size)`
            # and its `forward` needs to be called with `x_t` (from encoder) as `pre_synaptic_input_for_trace`
            # and its own output spikes as `post_synaptic_activity`.
            # This is a bit tricky with the current `CustomLIFCell` which assumes `x` in `forward(x, state)` is for the trace.
            #
            # Let's redefine `lif1` in init:
            # self.lif1 = CustomLIFCell(input_size=input_size, hidden_size=hidden_size, dt=0.001)
            # Then in forward:
            # lif1_current = self.fc1(x_t)
            # s_lif1, s1 = self.lif1(lif1_current, s1, pre_synaptic_for_trace=x_t) # Modified CustomLIFCell
            #
            # Sticking to current CustomLIFCell:
            # It calculates trace based on its direct input `x` and its output `s_out`.
            # So, if `lif1` is CustomLIFCell(hidden_size, hidden_size), its trace is for weights of size (hidden_size, hidden_size).
            # To apply 3-factor to `fc1`, we need a trace for `fc1`.
            #
            # Option: create a specific `TraceableLinearLIFLayer`
            # For now, let's assume `self.lif1` is a `CustomLIFCell` whose trace we will apply to `self.fc1`.
            # This means `self.lif1` must be initialized with `(input_size, hidden_size)` for its trace.
            # And its `forward` method's `x` argument will be `x_t` (encoder output),
            # and its `s_out` will be the post-synaptic spikes.
            # The LIF dynamics themselves will operate on `self.fc1(x_t)`. This is non-standard.
            #
            # Correct approach for CustomLIFCell as written:
            # If `CustomLIFCell` has `input_size` and `hidden_size` for its trace,
            # and it's applied *after* `fc1`, then `input_size` of cell is `fc1.out_features`.
            # `hidden_size` of cell is `fc1.out_features` (if it's just a cell).
            # The trace is `(fc1.out_features, fc1.out_features)`. This is for recurrent weights.
            #
            # To make the trace for `fc1` (an `nn.Linear`):
            # Trace dimensions: `(fc1.in_features, fc1.out_features)`.
            # Pre-synaptic activity: `x_t` (input to `fc1`).
            # Post-synaptic activity: `s_lif1` (output of `lif1` which processes `fc1(x_t)`).
            #
            # Let's make a conceptual wrapper for `fc1` and `lif1` for clarity in this example.
            # (This will be part of the "SDT Transformer" integration later if relevant)

            if self.use_custom_lif:

                # The `x` to `lif1.forward` is `lif1_current_in`.
                # The trace update needs `x_t` (pre to fc1) and `s_lif1` (post from lif1).

# Small fix for apply_three_factor_update import if it's not found due to path issues

# Final check on CustomLIFCell's trace logic:
# CustomLIFCell's trace is `(self.input_size, self.hidden_size)`.
# In `SimpleSNN`, `self.lif1 = CustomLIFCell(hidden_size, hidden_size)`.
# So, `self.lif1.eligibility_trace` is `(hidden_size, hidden_size)`.
# This trace is suitable for a recurrent connection on the `lif1` layer neurons,
# or for a linear layer of size `(hidden_size, hidden_size)` that inputs to `lif1`.
#
# The manual trace `self.fc1_eligibility_trace` is `(input_size, hidden_size)`,
# correctly corresponding to `self.fc1.weight`. This is the one we are using for `apply_three_factor_update`.
# The current script correctly uses this manually managed trace for `fc1`.
# The `use_custom_lif` flag is used to decide if `self.lif1` is `CustomLIFCell` or `StandardLIFCell`,
# and also gates the manual accumulation of `self.fc1_eligibility_trace`. This is a bit coupled but works for this example.
# A more decoupled approach would separate the choice of cell type from the decision to use plasticity on fc1.
# For example, an additional flag like `model.enable_fc1_plasticity = True`.
# The current setup is functional for demonstrating the concept.
